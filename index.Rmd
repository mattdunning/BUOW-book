# About

This book was originally written to document efforts taken to proof and consolidate all 
burrowing owl data from the Conway lab. Future uses will include generating figures and maps.

## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter includes the steps taken to clean data sheets and then import into SQLlite.
The code only needs to be run once so the purpose of publishing it is to reference how a task was completed
for future database cleaning projects. 


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
